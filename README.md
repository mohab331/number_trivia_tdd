# Number Trivia App

This is a Flutter project called "Number Trivia App" that demonstrates various concepts and packages applied to build a simple trivia application focused on numbers. The app provides interesting trivia about different numbers entered by the user.

## Concepts and Packages Utilized

The following concepts and packages have been applied in this project:

1. **TDD (Test Driven Development)**: The project has been developed using the Test Driven Development approach, where tests are written before the actual implementation to ensure better code quality and functionality.

2. **Testing (Unit Tests and Bloc Tests)**: The app includes both unit tests and bloc tests to thoroughly test individual components and the business logic managed by BLoCs (Business Logic Components).

3. **Clean Architecture (Layer-first Project Structure)**: The project follows the Clean Architecture principles to achieve separation of concerns and maintain a clear project structure with well-defined layers, making it more scalable and maintainable.

4. **Dependency Injection using Get_it**: Get_it package has been used for dependency injection, providing a clean and efficient way to manage and access dependencies across the application.

5. **State Management (Cubit)**: The app utilizes the Cubit package for state management, which allows for a reactive and predictable approach to manage application states.

6. **flutter_hooks**: The app leverages the `flutter_hooks` package to create reusable and reactive components using hooks, making the codebase concise and easy to maintain.

7. **Dio**: Dio package is used to make HTTP requests and handle network communication efficiently in the app.

8. **flutter_native_splash**: The `flutter_native_splash` package is used to set up native splash screens for the app, providing a smooth and seamless user experience during app startup.
